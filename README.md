# Data-Pipelines
A data pipeline is a series of automated processes or steps that are used to collect, process, and move data from one or more sources to a destination, typically a data warehouse or database. We will create a pipeline from start to end. Below is will be the stages; Coming Soon

START
### Database Creation:
- Task: Create a new MySQL database to store the integrated data.
- Software: MySQL, Python
- Task Description: Use Python with libraries like mysql-connector-python to connect to the MySQL database and execute SQL commands to create the database schema.

### Data Collection:
- Task: Extract data from the database and files.
- Software: Luigi, Python, SQL
- Task Description: Define Luigi tasks to extract data from the MySQL database using SQL queries. Use Python to execute SQL queries and retrieve data. For file extraction, use Python's file reading methods.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Task: Clean and preprocess the extracted data.
- Software: Apache Spark, Python
- Task Description: Utilize Python with libraries like Pandas for data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, transformation, and standardization. If necessary, use SQL within Python to perform data manipulations directly on the MySQL database.

### Data Integration:
- Task: Integrate the preprocessed data from both sources.
- Software: Apache Spark, Python
- Task Description: Use Python with Spark to integrate the preprocessed data from the database and files into a unified dataset. Spark DataFrame operations can be combined with Python functions for data integration.

### Data Loading to MySQL:
- Task: Load the integrated data into the MySQL database.
- Software: Luigi, Apache Spark, Python, SQL
- Task Description: Define a Luigi task to execute the data loading process. Use Python with Spark to write the integrated data into the MySQL database. SQL can be used within Python to execute SQL INSERT statements to load data into MySQL tables.

# Analytics

### Data Anlysis
- Task: Perform analysis and computations on the integrated dataset.
- Software: Apache Spark, Python
- Task Description: Utilize Python with Spark for data analysis tasks. Python can be used to define analysis logic and execute Spark operations on the integrated dataset. SQL can also be used within Spark SQL for querying and analyzing data.

### Data export and Reporting with Power BI:
- Task: Generate reports or visualizations using Power BI.
- Software: Power BI and Python
- Task Description: Use Python to export the analyzed data from the MySQL database or Spark DataFrame to a format compatible with Power BI (e.g., CSV, Excel). Connect Power BI to the exported data to create reports and visualizations.
- Task Description 2: Utilize Power BI's features and capabilities to create interactive reports, dashboards, and visualizations based on the exported data. Connect Power BI to the exported data source and design reports according to the analysis requirements
